/* It's time to select the fastest reindeer for Santa's journeys! ðŸ¦ŒðŸŽ„
Santa Claus has organized exciting reindeer races to determine which ones are in the best shape.

Your task is to display each reindeer's progress on a snow track in isometric format.

The information you receive:

indices: An array of integers representing each reindeer's progress on the track:
0: The lane is empty.
Positive number: The reindeer's current position from the beginning of the track.
Negative number: The reindeer's current position from the end of the track.
length: The length of each lane.
Return a string representing the race track:

Each lane has exactly length positions filled with snow (~).
Each reindeer is represented with the letter r.
Lanes are numbered at the end with /1, /2, etc.
The view is isometric, so the lower lanes are shifted to the right.
Examples:

drawRace([0, 5, -3], 10)
  ~~~~~~~~~~ /1
 ~~~~~r~~~~ /2
~~~~~~~r~~ /3


drawRace([2, -1, 0, 5], 8)
   ~~r~~~~~ /1
  ~~~~~~~r /2
 ~~~~~~~~ /3
~~~~~r~~ /4


drawRace([3, 7, -2], 12)
  ~~~r~~~~~~~~ /1
  ~~~r~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~r~~~ /2
~~~~~~~r~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~r~ /3
 */

const drawRace = (indices, length) => {
    let race = '';
    const numRacers = indices.length;
    for (let i = 0; i <= numRacers; i++) {
        let raceLane = '';
        if (indices[i] > 0) {
            raceLane = `${'~'.repeat(indices[i])}r${'~'.repeat(length - indices[i] - 1)}`;
        } else if (indices[i] < 0) {
            raceLane = `${'~'.repeat(length + indices[i])}r${'~'.repeat(indices[i] * - 1 - 1)}`;
        } else {
            raceLane = `${'~'.repeat(length)}`;
        }
        race += `${' '.repeat(numRacers - i)}${raceLane} /${i + 1}\n`;
    };
    return race.replace(/\n+$/, "");
};

const start = performance.now();

console.log(drawRace([3, 7, -2], 12));

const end = performance.now();
console.log(`Execution time: ${end - start} ms`);
